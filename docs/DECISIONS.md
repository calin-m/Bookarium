# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Next.js 15 App Router & React 19 Adoption
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Bookarium requires high-performance server rendering, streaming capabilities, and optimal client-side caching for a seamless reading experience.
- **Decision**: Adopt Next.js 15+ App Router with React 19, server components for skeleton shells, and client components for interactive reader/filters.
- **Consequences**: Fast initial load, modern React concurrent features, zero API keys required.

## ADR-002: Public Domain Zero-Copyright Enforcement
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: The application must only serve books that are 100% legally in the public domain.
- **Decision**: All API queries to Gutendex unconditionally include `copyright=false`. The API route proxy filters out any content flagged with restrictive copyrights.
- **Consequences**: Safe legal compliance, free open access without copyright friction.

## ADR-003: Zustand for Offline Bookshelf and Reader State
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Users should retain their reading positions, bookmarks, favorites, and theme preferences without requiring authentication or remote databases.
- **Decision**: Use Zustand with `persist` middleware backed by `localStorage`.
- **Consequences**: Zero latency, 100% offline persistence for client reading state.

## ADR-004: TanStack React Query for Server Data Caching
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Context**: Gutendex and book text requests should be cached client-side to prevent redundant network round-trips.
- **Decision**: Use TanStack React Query with a default `staleTime` of 5 minutes and optimistic updates where appropriate.
- **Consequences**: Smooth browsing with minimal load on public API mirrors.
